pi-forall
=========

A demo implementation of a simple dependently-typed language for OPLSS
(Used in 2022, 2014 and 2013)
Stephanie Weirich

The goal of this project is to bring up the design issues that occur in the
implementation languages like Agda, Coq, Epigram, Idris, etc. Of course, it
can't cover everything, but this code is a good starting point for discussion.

As its main purpose is didactic, the code itself has been written for
clarity, not for speed. The point of this implementation is an introduction to
practical issues of language design and how specific features interact with
each other. 

Furthermore, this code based includes a number of features (unit, booleans,
sigma types) which are all subsumed by the general mechanism for
datatypes. These are included to give examples before diving into the more
general, and much more complicated, code. 


Features
--------
  - Pure-type-system (PTS) representation (uniform syntax for all levels)
  - bidirectional type checking
  - irrelevant arguments (forall)
  - propositional equality 
  - indexed datatypes 


This code is open source. Feel free to extend or adapt it for your own
project.

Installation
----------
  pi-forall requires GHC and cabal or stack
  

Contents
--------

There are several versions of `pi-forall` in the repository. See the 
[documentation](https://github.com/sweirich/pi-forall/blob/2022/doc/oplss.pdf) for an extended description of what parts of the language
are covered by each version. 

Each implementation has the following structure:

```
<version>/
  pi/*.pi            example pi-forall files
  src/*.hs           source code
  app/Main.hs        entry point
  README.md (this file)
  LICENSE
  pi-forall.cabal
  stack.yaml         

```
