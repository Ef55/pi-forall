PiForall language
------------------

This language implementation is designed to accompany four lectures at
OPLSS during Summer 2022. Notes for these lectures are included in the 
distribution:

- [oplss.pdf](doc/oplss.pdf)

See also the documentation [README.md](doc/README.md) for details about 
how the notes are typeset.

These lecture notes corresponds to an increasingly expressive demo
implementation of dependently-typed lambda calculus.

- [version1/](version1/):   Basic language implementation
- [version2/](version2/):   Basic language extended with nontrivial definitional equality
- [version3/](version3/):   Above, extended with irrelevant arguments
- [full/](full/):           Full language with datatypes 

See also the implementation [README.md](main/README.md) for more details.

All of these versions are excerpted from the marked up files in the directory:

- [main/](main/)

All edits should be to the code in the `main` directory. The above versions
are included in the repo just for convenience.

Videos from the 2014 lectures are also available from the 
[OPLSS website](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer14/curriculum.html). If you want to watch these videos, you should look at the 
2014 branch of the repository.

An abridged version of these lectures was given at the Compose
Conference, January 2015.
