Pi-Forall language
------------------

This language implementation is designed to accompany four lectures at
OPLSS during Summer 2022. Notes for these lectures are included in the 
distribution:

- [notes.md](notes.md):    Basic language with Type:Type 
- [notes2.md](notes2.md):  Implementation of basic languages
- [notes3.md](notes3.md):  Definitional and propositional equality
- [notes4.md](notes4.md):  Datatypes, with parameters and indices, erased arguments

Videos for these lectures are also available from the 
[OPLSS website](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer14/curriculum.html).

An abridged version of these lectures was given at the Compose
Conference, January 2015. 

- [compose.md](old/compose.md): Overview of pi-forall implementation

These lecture notes corresponds to an increasingly expressive demo
implementation of dependently-typed lambda calculus.

- [version1/](version1/):   Basic language implementation
- [version2/](version2/):   Basic language extended with nontrivial definitional equality
- [full/](full/):           Full language with datatypes and erased arguments

See also the implementation [README.md](main/README.md) for more details.

All of these versions are excerpted from the marked up files in the directory:

- [main/](main/)

All edits should be to the code in the `main` directory. The above versions
are included in the repo just for convenience.
